# User Story
<p>Using Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
<p>As an employee with a busy schedule, I want to add important events to a daily planner so I can manage my time effectively.<p>
  
# Acceptance Criteria
<p>
1. When using a daily planner to create a schedule, when I open the planner on the current day, it is displayed at the top of the calendar.
<p>
2. When I scroll down, I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours.
<p>
3. When I view the timeblocks for that day, each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
<p>
4. When I click into a timeblock, I can enter an event.
<p>
5. When I click the save button for that timeblock, the text for that event is saved in local storage.
<p>
6. When I refresh the page, the saved events persist.
